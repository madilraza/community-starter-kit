# Your GitHub Learning Lab Repository for Community Starter Kit

Welcome to **your** repository for your GitHub Learning Lab course. This repository will be used during the different activities that I will be guiding you through to learn about making your project friendlier for collaboration.

Oh! I haven't introduced myself...

I'm the GitHub Learning Lab bot and I'm here to help guide you in your journey to learn and master the various topics covered in this course. I will be using Issue and Pull Request comments to communicate with you. In fact, I already added a pull request for you to check out.
